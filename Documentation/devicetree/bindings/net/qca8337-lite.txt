QCA8337 is a switch product family used in home gateway. The QCA8337-lite driver
is a temporary driver done to initialize the QCA8337 hardware at init.

The following device-tree properties may be used to describe the expected
default switch configuration.

Compatible: Should contain "qca8337-lite"

Optional Properies:

- qca,vlan-portmap: one or more sets of 2 cells. Each set represent a certain
  VLAN port base group. The first cell indicates the VLAN ID, while the second
  set represents a bitmask of all the switch ports to include in this VLAN.

Example:

	qca8337-lite {
		device-type = "network";
		compatible = "qca8337-lite";
		mdiobus = <&mdio>;
		qca,vlan-portmap = <
			0x1	0x42	/* VLAN1 Ports 1/6 */
			0x2	0x5	/* VLAN2 Ports 0/2 */
		>;
	}
