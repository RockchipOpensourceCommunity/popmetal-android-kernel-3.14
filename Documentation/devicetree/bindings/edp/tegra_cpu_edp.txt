* Tegra VDD_CPU EDP Management

The CPU EDP management prevents the CPU from drawing more
current from voltage regulator. Limit maximum CPU frequency
based on temperature and number of on-line CPUs to keep
CPU rail current within power supply capabilities.

.. CPU EDP node required properties:

- compatible : "nvidia,tegra124-cpu-edp", "nvidia,tegra132-cpu-edp"
- nvidia,edp-limit: maximum cpu current support, in milliampere.
                This vlaue is platform dependent. The CPU EDP management
                will limit the cpu frequency as neccessary to keep
                VDD CPU consumption within this value.

Example:

cpu_edp {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-cpu-edp";
	nvidia,edp-limit = <8000>;
};
