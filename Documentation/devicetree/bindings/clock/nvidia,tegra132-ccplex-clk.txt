NVIDIA Tegra132 ccplex clocks

This binding uses the common clock binding:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

The Tegra132 ccplex clock module on Tegra132 is the HW module responsible
for the ccplex related clocks.

Required properties :
- compatible : Should be "nvidia,tegra132-ccplex-clk"
- reg : Should contain ccplex clock registers location and length
- #clock-cells : Should be 1.
  In clock consumers, this cell represents the clock ID exposed by the
  ccplex clock module. The assignments may be found in header file
  <dt-bindings/clock/tegra132-ccplex.h>.

Example SoC include file:

/ {
	ccplex-clock@0,70040000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra132-ccplex-clk";
		reg = <0x0 0x70040000 0x0 0x1000>;
		status = "okay";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

};
